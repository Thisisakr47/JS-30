# JS-30

This repository contains **my version** of all the projects which I have created from the course **JavaScript30 by WesBos**

*****************************************************
## Projects
- `Drum Kit` - In this project I created an **Electrical Drum Kit** which will take inputs from the keys pressed from the keyboard and would produce the sound accordingly. Click [here](https://github.com/Thisisakr47/JS-30/tree/main/1.%20Drum%20Kit) for the source code. 
- `Clock` - I used CSS transform property and JS in this project to create a **JS + CSS Clock**. It shows the Hours/Minutes/Seconds/AM-PM in **analog** fashion. Click [here](https://github.com/Thisisakr47/JS-30/tree/main/2.%20Clock) for the source code.
